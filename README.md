A framework for a projectile system in Unreal Engine 5.1

The framework was made using blueprints.

It supports splash dmg, dot dmg, slow down and chain shooting of projectiles.
The projectiles can be defined with a data table.
The mesh and material of the projectile can be set in datatables.
A launch and hit sfx and vfx and a flight vfx can be set in the datatables.

The Towers and enemy are just there to showcase the framework.
